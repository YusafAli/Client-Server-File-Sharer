# Client-Server-File-Sharer
A small semester project. Send and receive files over a local network. List files in a directory, make new file (simple file), delete a file at the server side. Console Based program.
This project was done by Yusaf Ali in the fall 2015.
Due to limited knowledge of the language, tools and the thing I was trying to do (telnet Implementation), Only some commands can work.
Commands like dir for directory folder structure output, ? for help, copy srcname destname, etc
If u want to know more about the commands, type ? in the console, it will display instructions.
Also, there is a password protection system, not a system just string comparison on the server side, a password.txt is provided,
in which a username and password is provided.
It is written as;
  username password
for example
  zig zag
  zig is the username
  zag is the password
More users with password can be added
This program is made by a noob, for a semester project.
In the process of doing it, I happened to gain a little bit knowledge about the Socket Programming, ofcourse I knew about Sockets,
and implemented socket programming in java, throught which commands and data are shared across the local network.



P.S. Sorry about the bad Grammar and explanation.
